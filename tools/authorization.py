"""
Authorization Check Tool for MCP Server.

This tool checks if the authenticated user is authorized to perform 
the detected operation (SEARCH, CREATE, UPDATE) based on their user type.

WORKFLOW: This is STEP 4 - called after:
         1. authenticate_user
         2. validate_email
         3. detect_intent
NEXT STEP: If authorized, call 'generate_action_plan' tool (step 5).
           If NOT authorized, STOP - do not call any other tools.
